    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make the best pot roast with minimum effort and this easy
         slow cooker recipe. The roast cooks on top of potatoes, carrots, 
         and celery, resulting in incredibly tender meat and veggies that 
         are perfect for dinner any day of the week, especially in the autumn!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes (6, medium sized)</li>
        <li>Yellow onions (1, medium sized)</li>
        <li>Celery (2 stalks)</li>
        <li>Baby carrots (1.5 cups)</li>
        <li>Beef roast (3 pounds)</li>
        <li>Beef bouillon (3 cubes)</li>
        <li>Water (0.5 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut potatoes, onions, and celery into fairly large chunks; 
            place in the bottom of a slow cooker along with baby carrots. 
            Place roast on top of vegetables. 
            Place 3 bouillon cubes randomly on top of the roast and 
            pour in 1/2 cup water.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours or on High for 
            4 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the 
            thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F 
            (65 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer roast to a platter. Remove vegetables using a 
            slotted spoon and arrange them around the roast.</li>
