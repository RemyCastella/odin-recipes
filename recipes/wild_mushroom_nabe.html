    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The chorus of nightime crickets and refreshing breeze remind us
        that summer is coming to an end, ushering in the nostalgic, cozy
         and bountiful autumn.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite autumn memories is when I went with my girlfriend
        to buy wild mushrooms from a farmer's market up in the Hokkaido mountains to 
        preparing a wild mushroom nabe on our camping trip. We enjoyed piping hot 
        bowl after piping hot bowl as we sat under the stars, warmed up by the campfire
        and the wild mushroom delight.</p>
      <p>Now, whenever I notice the first signs of autumn, I know the perfect time has come
        for some hearty wild mushroom nabe!</p>
